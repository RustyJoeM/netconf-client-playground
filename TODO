- add comments to operation's implementation from NETCONF RFC in regard to what the requests do etc.?

- SSH channel - match request with response!

- NETCONF capabilities currently raw strings (plus few standard enums)
    - may want to add some prefix/name/version/suffix granularity?

- RPC custom attributes not taken into account in request/response - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6241#section-4.2

- fancy rust-doc comments all around!
