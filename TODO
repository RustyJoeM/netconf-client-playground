- add NMDA operations rfc 8526 - <get-data>, <edit-data>...

- add comments to operation's implementation from NETCONF RFC in regard to what the requests do etc.?

- SSH channel - match request with response!

- NETCONF capabilities currently raw strings (plus few standard enums)
    - may want to add some prefix/name/version/suffix granularity?

- RPC custom attributes not taken into account in request/response - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6241#section-4.2

- fancy rust-doc comments all around!

- use-cases:
    - dump RPC for various operations
    - live REPL mode (async CLI?)
    - GUI (distant future, if at all?)
