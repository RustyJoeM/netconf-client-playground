- de-clutter numerous mod/pub use-es...

- !!! tests when API stabilizes...

- normalize bail!s error formatting/reporting for capability validation (at least some common macro for cap. breach + value causing it )

- change String for nested items into some alias to allow smoother update to some working xml node later?
    (get/get-config's 'data', validate's source 'config', etc.)

- add NMDA operations rfc 8526 - <get-data>, <edit-data>...

- add comments to operation's implementation from NETCONF RFC in regard to what the requests do etc.?

- SSH channel - match request with response!

- NETCONF capabilities currently raw strings (plus few standard enums)
    - may want to add some prefix/name/version/suffix granularity?

- RPC custom attributes not taken into account in request/response - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6241#section-4.2

- fancy rust-doc comments all around!

- use-cases:
    - dump RPC for various operations
    - live REPL mode (async CLI?)
    - GUI (distant future, if at all?)

- NetconfSession - impl Drop & close-session request inside?
