- update helps for subcommands

- recommendation to use `shlex` for line.split instead of String::split_whitespace?

    https://crates.io/crates/shlex/1.1.0

- add optional CLI sub-modes for dump/send only to save on first word prefix in dedicated user-session...

- make available commands dynamic (hide/disable?), according to client/server capabilities?

- introduce fluent templates (or other localization crate/tools) to allow for multi-lang CLI?
  - might run into problems/need of restructuring comments/clap annotations for commands... though might be nice feature
